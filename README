NAME
    Test::VCR::LWP - Record and playback LWP interactions.

VERSION
    version 0.1

SYNOPSIS
            withVCR {
                    my $res = $useragent->get('http://metacpan.org/');
            };

DESCRIPTION
    Records HTTP transactions done thru LWP to a file and then replays them.
    Allows your tests suite to be fast, dterministic and accurate.

    Inspired by (stolen from) http://relishapp.com/vcr/vcr/docs

OO Interface
    You can use the object oriented interface, but the basic decorator style
    function interface is recommended.

    Using the OO interface:

            my $vcr = Test::VCR::LWP->new(tape => 'mytape.tape');
        
            $vcr->run(sub {
                    my $ua  = LWP::UserAgent->new;
                    my $res = $ua->get('http://www.perl.org/');
                
                    if ($_->is_recording) {
                            do_something();
                    }
            });
        
  withVCR
    Mocks out any calls to LWP::UserAgent with Test::VCR::LWP. Takes a
    number of flags which are passed to the VCR constructor, and finally a
    code ref. For example:

            withVCR {
                    my $req = $ua->post('http://oo.com/object');
                    isa_ok($req, 'HTTP::Response');
                
                    if ($_->is_recording) {
                            sleep(5);
                    }
                
                    my $second = $ua->get('http://oo.com/object/' . $res->id);
            } tape => 'my_test.tape';

    Or to have the name of the calling sub define the tape name:

            withVCR {
                    my $req = $ua->post('http://oo.com/object');
                    isa_ok($req, 'HTTP::Response');
            };

    The tape file we be placed in the same directory as the script if no
    tape argument is given. If this function is called outside of a
    subroutine, the filename of the current perl script will be used to
    derive a tape filename.

    Within the code block, $_ is the current vcr object. The `is_recording'
    method might be useful.

TODO
    * The docs are pretty middling at the moment.
